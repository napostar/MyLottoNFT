# MyLottoNFT
A raffle or lottery based NFT project where you own your ticket as an NFT, and submit it for drawings for a chance to win! The prize for the lotto contract is the grand prize of ether that is stored in the contract. This was done to make it simpler to trust since the funds are instantly available and controlled by the contract.  

A future improvement would be to support putting funds programatically onto a DEX or other interest bearing site, and make the grand prize based off the interest to make the lotto more sustainable long term.
