/**
 * The MyLotto Lottery Contract was designed with the following requirements/features:
 * -For simplicity and trust, player pay directly to the contract, and it holds the winner funds.
 * -Use the MyLottoNFT contract for entries. This ensures there can only be one winner since each nft's drawing numbers are unique
 * -Drawings happen on a reoccuring basis, with only one open at a time.
 * -Contract states/phases: Not Started -> Entries Open -> Entries Closed -> VRF Drawn -> Winner Withdraw -> Not Started -> ...
 * -No entries can be submitted when a lotto hasn't been started
 * -Enteries must be submitted (and paid) before the drawing's entry period ends, following the commit then reveal pattern
 * -Use Chainlink VRF to make the drawing fair
 * -Winners have a constant number of days after a drawing to withdraw funds
 * -A new drawing can't be started until after the winner withdraw period, so the grand prize value can't change while a drawing is open
 * -60% of all ticket proceeds go directly to the Grand Prize, the rest can be withdrawn by the contract owner to pay for ongoing expenses
 * -Contract is Pausable, making it so we can pause new entries, prevent starting new drawings, but not prevent a winner's ability to withdraw
